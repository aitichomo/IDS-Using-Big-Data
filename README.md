# Intrusion Detection System Using Big Data

This repository contains the implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging Big Data technologies and machine learning techniques to detect network intrusions effectively.

## Overview

Our IDS solution utilizes deep learning models to analyze network traffic and identify potential threats in real-time. By harnessing the power of Big Data, the system can process and analyze large volumes of network data efficiently using KDD Cup data set.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Capable of identifying network intrusions in real-time.
- **Big Data Integration**: Utilizes Big Data technologies for scalable and efficient data processing.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various deep learning models for accurate intrusion detection.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes comprehensive data preprocessing steps to handle raw network data.
