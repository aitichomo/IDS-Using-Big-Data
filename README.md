# Intrusion Detection System Using Big Data

This repository contains the implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging Big Data technologies and machine learning techniques to detect network intrusions effectively.

## Overview

Our IDS solution utilizes deep learning models to analyze network traffic and identify potential threats in real-time. By harnessing the power of Big Data, the system can process and analyze large volumes of network data efficiently using KDD Cup data set.
